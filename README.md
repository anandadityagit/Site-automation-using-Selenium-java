This repository contains code for a basic automation script using Selenium WebDriver to navigate a specific path on the DataMatics Pulse website (https://www.pulse.datamatics.com/dlintranet/Login.do?method=showLogin).

Requirements:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
Selenium WebDriver
ChromeDriver

Instructions:

Download and install the JRE from Java SE Downloads: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.
Download the ChromeDriver for your specific browser version from WebDriver Downloads: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
Place the ChromeDriver executable in a directory accessible by your system.
Build and run the pulseautomate.java file using a Java IDE or compiler.
Note:

This script uses hardcoded credentials for login. You'll need to modify the script to enter your own username and password.
This is a basic example and may require adjustments depending on any website changes.
